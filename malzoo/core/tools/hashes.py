The Hasher class is build to generate a number of hashes of a sample. 
Currently, it can calculate:
    [*] MD5
    [*] SHA-1
    [*] PE hash
    [*] Fuzzy hash
    [*] Import hash

Note that only PE files are supported with PE hash

TODO:
    [ ] Peform a filetype check
    [ ] Add more hash types
    [ ] Create exception handling
